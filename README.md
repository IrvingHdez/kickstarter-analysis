## Excel sheet with analysis
[Link to GitHub](https://github.com/IrvingHdez/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)

## Overview of Project
*Utilize the built-in tools of excel to get important statistical information and formulate an analysis based on the data*
*From the analyzed dataset, answer the question*
- how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
*To learn advanced features of excel such as PivotTables and PivotCharts as well as excel formulas.
Also to publish the results on a file storage and version control software such as GitHub*

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*- A challenge could be when new data has to be dynamically added over time since the analysis would have to be re-done.*
*- If data is not well formatted then it would have to be cleaned up before starting the analysis*

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the extracted data we can derive the following:
  - Overall it's more likely for a campaign to succeed
  - There's a greater number of campaigns that launch in May

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the extracted data we can derive the following:
  - Most campaigns with a goal greater than $50,000 were cancelled
  - Most successful campaigns had a goal of less than $5,000 or between $35,000 and $45,000
  - Not a sigle play campaign was cancelled.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
*limited historical data*

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
*Bar chart to visualize the goal amounts per category/sub-category*
